Class
- Building block of an application.
- Applications consist of multiple classes each responsible for particular behavior.
- Real world example (Blog site)
	- Three layers: Presentation (PostView), Business Logic/Domain (Post), and Data Access/Persistence (PostRepository)
- Anatomy of a class
	- Data (fields)
	- Behavior (methods)

Object
- Instance of a class that resides in memory.

Constructors
- Method that is called when an instance of a class is created.
- Why?
	- Put an object in an early state(initialize fields).
- Has the exact same name as the class.
- No return type.

Constructor Overloading
- Having a method by the same name but different signatures (Return type, name, and type of inputs)
